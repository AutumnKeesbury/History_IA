Confederate States of America [CSA]) with Great Britain, and the effects of this relationship on the prospect of the British Parliament's diplomatic 
recognition of the CSA as a sovereign nation. To do this, I shall rely on the vast contemporary records of exports and manufactures, the body of post-
contemporary literature regarding the relations of both nations, and the large base of correspondences and personal records of those involved.

Douglass C. \shortcite{northeconomicgrowth1966} (1966). In this book, North argues that the critical period of economic development in the United States
was, contrary to the accepted narrative at the time, not in
